# Hate Speech Detection Using Backpropagation in Indonesian Language

This project was build when i was working on internship in middle of 2020. Although it was a first commit but this project is already done at that time.

In this "Hate Speech Detection" model a.k.a Classification on Hate Speech, i was tasked to research some machine learning model and compare the results between them, and this is the one of it. There were two class that i'm using in this project one is 'Hate Speech' and other is 'Non-Hate Speech'.

It's all thanks to the researchers before me who already done working on some result that i can used for this research. Below are some of their repositories if you want to use them :
- [Stopwords](https://github.com/louisowen6/NLP_bahasa_resources/blob/master/combined_stop_words.txt) - it was combined stopwords made by [louisowen](https://github.com/louisowen6)
- [Normalization Dictionary](https://github.com/okkyibrohim/id-multi-label-hate-speech-and-abusive-language-detection/blob/master/new_kamusalay.csv) - this one really helps me to normalize the words in each data created by [okkyibrohim](https://github.com/okkyibrohim)
- [Dataset](https://github.com/ialfina/id-hatespeech-detection) - Last but not least the dataset that i used was made by [ialfina](https://github.com/ialfina)

Note :
Sorry if I didn't attach the dataset and preprocessing files. I think it would be better if you get the dataset directly to the original owner. And for preprocessing files, because I always use those file in different nlp projects, so it's better not to attach them for your health. Almost forget for the last thing, in this project I almost 80% not using any library too, cause i want to stick with the math process in this model.

Cheers!!
